## REACT TR SAMPLE PLAYER

This is a copy of my drum sampler done for FCC's Frontend Course. For now this is just a copy of the [original project](https://react-tr-sample-player.netlify.app/),however there are some
improvements planned:

- Refactoring as Class and Id spec from FCC make things messy
- Add a sample toggle
- 16 Pads each + toggle alternative samples
- Responsive Styles

This readme will get updated alongside the project.
